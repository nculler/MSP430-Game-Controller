# Game Controller Project

## Basic Information
- **Institution:** UNCC
- **Course:** Embedded Systems
- **Author:** Nathan Culler
- **Project:** Project 5 - Game Controller

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the creation of a basic game controller using an MSP430 development board. The MSP430 is responsible for controlling the game through a potentiometer and serial communication (UART). The game itself was coded in Python.

## Materials Used
- **MSP-EXP430FR2355** - TI's MSP430 development board
- **Grove Potentiometer** - Analog input device for game control

## Skills Showcased
- General-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO)
- Timers for precise control
- Analog-to-Digital Conversion (ADC) for potentiometer input
- Serial Communication (UART) for data transmission
- Microcontroller Unit (MCU) internal clocks configuration
- Interrupt handling for efficient processing

## How to Run
1. Connect the Grove Potentiometer to the appropriate Grove connector on the MSP430.
2. Use the main.c file for the program code. 
3. Compile and flash the firmware onto the MSP430.

## Additional Information
More details about this project can be found in the **Lab 5 - Game Controller** PDF.
